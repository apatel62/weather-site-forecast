## Description

Uses the 5-day weather forecast API to retrieve weather data for cities. The site is deployed using Render. The site will lead to a weather dashboard where users can type a city to see today's weather and the weather forecast for the next 5 days. In addition, users will be able to see their search history. The image below shows the weather dashboard after launching the website.
